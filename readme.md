### Arbfinder
A quick (messy) arbitrage opportunity finder for crypto. Currently supports bittrex, binance and cryptopia but uses bitex which means other markets could be implemented pretty easily.

Pull requests and improvements are welcome.

#### Usage
```bash
# First configure API keys in config.py (as per utils.py).
$ source .envrc
$ python arbfinder.py
```
